C# Projects
These are some small projects I made with C# and .Net Framework

Projects:
Car Insurance
NFL Stats

Car Insurance
This project is an MVC application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes users input on policy information
and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all the quotes
that have been issued.

NFL Stats
This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display football stats for the  purposes of 
fantasy football. It is an MVC web application that utilizes entity framework 6 for data access and a code first workflow.
It is still a work in progress.
